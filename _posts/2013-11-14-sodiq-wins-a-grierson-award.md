Amazing news for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SodiqFilm" target="_blank">Sodiq</a>&#8221; documentary that I scored, winning a prestigious Grierson Award for Best Student Documentary. This is apparently the top accolade for documentaries in this country. Director Yemi is currently out in Nigeria for it&#8217;s screening in the <a title="Africa International Film Festival" href="https://www.facebook.com/AfricaFilmFest?directed_target_id=0" target="_blank">Africa International Film Festival</a>Â plus the film has been nominated for the IDA Documentary Awards, the USA equivalent of the Griersons. Fingers crossed!
