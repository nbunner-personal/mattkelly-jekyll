&#8220;Miss Todd&#8221; directed by Kristina Yee and &#8220;Sleeping with the Fishies&#8221; directed by Yousif Al-Khalifa, both scored by me, are to have their Asian Premieres atÂ Seoul Cartoon and Animation Festival 2013.

&#8220;Miss Todd&#8221; is a stop-motion animated musical using cut out paper puppets about the first woman to design and build an aeroplane, Lilian Todd in 1910. The trailer can be seen on my video reel page.

&#8220;Sleeping With The Fishies&#8221; is a hand drawn animation about a lonely female fishmonger, fearful of human contact, who develops feelings for a guy who looks like a fish. Trailer coming soon!
