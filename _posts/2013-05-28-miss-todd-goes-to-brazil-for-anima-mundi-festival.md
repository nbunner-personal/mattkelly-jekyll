&#8220;Miss Todd&#8221; will make it&#8217;s South American Premiere in the non-competitive Panorama section of the prestigious Anima Mundi 2013. Also at the festival in the non-competitive &#8220;Animation of Course&#8221; sections are some chums&#8217; animations &#8220;First Light&#8221; byÂ Wing Yan Lillian Fu and &#8220;Robomax&#8221; by Moayad Fahmi. If anyone would like to pay for me to go then that would be really good, thanks.
