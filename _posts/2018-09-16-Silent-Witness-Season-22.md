Very excited to be writing the music for Silent Witness season 22 with Andy Price and Nick Walker. We’ve been writing away since May and will be finished in January 2019 when it will be broadcast. Gives me a nice opportunity to put my weird and wonky hat on mashing up lots of acoustic live instrument stuff with morbid electronica science noise gadgets. Silent Witness very much has a “sound” that has been great to learn and dive into the production styles and we’re respecting that sound whilst now pushing things forward! They are also great layered juicy plots to delve into the characters/subtext/dilemmas and of course….MURRDURR! (Best said like Taggart would).
