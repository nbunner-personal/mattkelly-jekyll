I&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed working on this gentle and moving doc about the last Argentinian cowboys and their way of life slowing dying out. The slow death of the more natural, holistic traditions is a fairly well trodden idea in films but this one really got me! I also discovered some lovely Argentinian folk whilst researching music ideas for this. Check [this](http://open.spotify.com/artist/0mxbcvmxSrQu0Z0qQ33gFy "missa kriolla") out for those with spotify.
