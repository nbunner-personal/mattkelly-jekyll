So so happy that Miss Todd won the top Gold honours in the Best Foreign Film category at the 40th Student Academy Awards.Â It&#8217;s the first time an animation has won the award ever.

&#8211; Like ever ever?

&#8211; ever ever.

Let alone a musical animation <img src="/img/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Such a lovely end to a fantastic week out in LA.
