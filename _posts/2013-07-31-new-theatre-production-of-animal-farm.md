I&#8217;m so excited and happy to have been chosen from over 400 applicants to score the forthcoming theatre production of George Orwell&#8217;s &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; by Flying Bear productions. Puppets, animation, multi-media-primal-folk-classical-semi-improv-experimentalism. First workshop beginning of August, improvising with puppets! YEAH!
