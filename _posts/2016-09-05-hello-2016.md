Hello, well it has been a while, I&#8217;ve been really fortunate to have worked on some great projects so far this year, such as&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Miss Transgender: Britain&#8217;s New Beauty Queens</strong></span>

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-218" src="/mjkwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-14.36.51-300x142.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-05 at 14.36.51" width="300" height="142" />](/mjkwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-14.36.51.png) 

Feature Documentary Dir. Jasleen Kaur Sethi for Minnow Films/BBC1

A documentary following three transgender women competing in the 2015 Miss Transgender Beauty pageant. Really interesting doc and equally interesting to score, trying to capture a sense of bravery and elegance but combining it with occasional vulnerability and the _KERPOW!_ one would expect from these sorts of emotionally charged competitions.

Fiction Feature Film Dir. Boo Junfeng, Augenschein Filmproduktion.

Beautiful and highly original Singapore arthouse film about an executioner&#8217;s apprentice, recently premiering at Cannes 2016. I co-scored this with Alexander Zeke, ranging from bubbling and restless strings to claustrophobic sound design, such a rich, moving and understated film all round. Check it out if you can!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Martha Tilston New Album (and new direction!)</strong></span>

I&#8217;ve been making music away from film both in the studio and on stage with [Martha Tilston](http://www.marthatilston.co.uk) singersongstress. It&#8217;s always a magical experience. We&#8217;ve been beavering away on her new album with a new direction for her heading _BEATS_wards, MUCH fun and we&#8217;ve been signed to Membran records in Germany! Here&#8217;s to some more European tours!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Every Split Second Counts (The History of Olympic Time Keeping)</strong></span>

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-220" src="/mjkwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-15.11.32-300x125.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-05 at 15.11.32" width="300" height="125" />](/mjkwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-05-at-15.11.32.png) 

Documentary for Omega time keeping. Dir John Dower. Pulse Films.

Well&#8230;..I was amazed how engrossed I was by this film, time keeping sounds likes a rather drab subject, but when you get into the history and sports people&#8217;s stories and their dedication, either to be awarded or cruuuuuelly denied  <img src="http://www.matthewjameskelly.co.uk/mjkwp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />at the finish line by thousandths of a second&#8230;.crushing, uplifting. Anyway enough of my opinion, you can watch the whole thing [HERE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WOydolQPjw)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Can&#8217;t Cope, Won&#8217;t Cope</strong></span>

6-part TV series Dir. Cathy Brady. Deadpan pictures for RTE Ireland.

Great comedy drama series written by Stefanie Preisner, following the relationship of two twenty-something party girls. I loved working on this, really great mix of comedy and drama and letting me go a bit leftfield and wonky at times (love a bit of wonky!).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>UPCOMING</strong></span>

So just about to dive into some string arrangements for Ninja Tune&#8217;s Jono McCleery for his forthcoming album and then onto a feature film called &#8220;Popeye&#8221; written and directed by Kirsten Tan, starring&#8230;.an elephant! can&#8217;t wait.
