&#8220;Mass of Men&#8221; directed by Gabriel Gauchet, cold and minimalist score by one Matthew Kelly, continues it&#8217;s great success by winning the Royal Television Society 2013 Best Postgraduate Fiction Film. &#8220;Mass of Men&#8221; is about how a cold impersonal beaurocratic system can yield even more chilling reactions from the people within it.

The Golden Leopard, San Sebastien 2012

Double win of Critic&#8217;s prize and BDMA for Best Short, Janela IFF 2012
