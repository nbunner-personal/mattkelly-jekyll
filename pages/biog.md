I have been playing music since the age of 5. I focussed my music to film studies at NFTS and was awarded a rare “Excellent” for my masters degree. I play a number of instruments (violin/viola/cello, flute, clarinet, guitars, dilruba, zither plus numerous oddities) and often incorporate improvisation and live experimental textures into my scores. I also have a keen love for electronic gadgets and manipulation should the story call for such styles. In 2018 I was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for the score to “I Am Not A Witch” directed by Rungano Nyoni (other nominees including Carter Burwell and Paul Weller!), the film went on to win a **BAFTA** for Outstanding Debut Feature film. Other notable awards are the **BAFTA** winning short animation “Sleeping with the Fishies” directed by Yousif Al-Khalifa and the student **OSCAR winning** musical animation “Miss Todd” directed by Kristina Yee. Musical collaborations and releases include the artists Coldcut, Vashti Bunyan, Lamb, Fink, Maribou State to name a few and working as assistant to Patrick Doyle.
